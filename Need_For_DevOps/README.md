## 🌐 What is DevOps?

**DevOps = Development + Operations.**
It’s a **culture + set of practices + tools** that bring **developers (who write code)** and **operations (who run/maintain the systems)** together to:

* Build software **faster**
* Test it **reliably**
* Deploy it **continuously**
* Monitor and improve it in **real-time**

Think of it as breaking the wall between *“people who build the software”* and *“people who deploy and run it.”*

## 🛠️ Why do we need DevOps?

Before DevOps, there were big problems in software delivery:

1. **Slow release cycles** – It took weeks or months to get new features to production.
2. **Communication gaps** – Dev team said: *“Code works on my machine.”* Ops team said: *“It broke in production!”*
3. **Manual deployments** – Lots of human errors during setup, deployment, patching.
4. **Scaling issues** – Hard to quickly scale apps to handle more users.
5. **Unreliable systems** – Bugs slipped into production, and rollback was painful.

DevOps solves this by introducing **automation + collaboration + monitoring**.

## ⏳ What was the method followed previously?

### **1. Traditional (Waterfall Model)**

* Code was built in **phases**: Requirements → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
* Each team worked in **silos** (no overlap).
* Testing happened only *after* development ended.
* Deployment was a **big-bang event** (very risky).

**Problems:** Slow, rigid, late bug discovery, poor communication.

---

### **2. Agile (before DevOps)**

* Agile improved things → small iterations (sprints), faster feedback, customer involvement.
* But Agile mainly focused on **Dev + QA**.
* Deployment/Operations was still manual and **not automated**.

**Problem left:** Agile helped coding/testing speed, but deployments were still slow, error-prone, and ops was still a bottleneck.

## 🚀 Why DevOps over the old methods?

* DevOps extends Agile into **deployment & operations**.
* Continuous Integration (CI) → code is tested and merged daily.
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) → software is automatically deployed.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) → servers, environments, cloud infra are automated.
* Monitoring/Logging → faster issue detection and recovery.

👉 Result:

* Faster releases (multiple per day possible).
* Better quality (bugs caught early).
* Reliable deployments (automation reduces human error).
* Developers and Ops work as **one team**, not silos.

---

⚡ In short:

* **Waterfall** → slow & siloed.
* **Agile** → faster dev/test, but ops was still a bottleneck.
* **DevOps** → automation + collaboration across dev, test, and ops → faster, reliable delivery.
